                    <p>
                        WebClear is a long-standing service within Societe Generale’s Global Transaction Banking suite.
                        In 2023, it began a strategic migration to SG Markets, the bank’s modern platform for corporate
                        and institutional clients. The objective of the migration was to modernize the experience, align
                        it with SG Markets standards, and support future scalability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My mandate:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lead the UX vision and workflow redesign.</li>
                        <li>Introduce and scale a user-centered design approach across the product team.</li>
                        <li>Support technical teams in creating a responsive experience suitable for the
                            platform’s diverse usage contexts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="h3">Approach and design process</h2>
                    <p>
                        The project progressed in cycles, defined and planned together with the product team and
                        considering business priorities, UX needs and the global roadmap. Each cycle focused on a
                        portion of the service, moving from discovery to validation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since we were working within the context of a platform migration, I prioritized reworking
                        the core components and navigation first, and then implemented a strategy to maintain the legacy
                        code within the new experience, while the rest of the parts were being built.
                    </p>

                        <h3 class="h6">1. Framing & discovery</h3>
                        <p>
                            Working closely with the product team and expert users, I formalized the problem space,
                            user personas, and data requirements. We mapped the existing user experience end to end to
                            understand current journeys, and documented functional elements, data structures, and API
                            dependencies. This provided a solid foundation for the redesign and gave us a shared view of
                            constraints, pain points, and opportunities. Some key opportunities emerged:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simplifying navigation by reorganizing it around user goals rather
                                than technical data models.</li>
                            <li>Reducing task completion time through modern components and interaction
                                patterns from our design system.</li>
                            <li>Adopting flexible, responsive layouts that take advantage of modern browsers for
                                richer information displays and better adaptation to different screen sizes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="h6">2. Wireframing & navigation model</h3>
                        <p>
                            We began each phase by refining user flows based on the identified opportunities and updated
                            data requirements, ensuring alignment with both BU and SG Markets standards. Together with
                            the product team, we iterated on these flows through a series of workshops until navigation,
                            actions, and displayed data were fully defined and understood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using these validated flows, I created wireframes that covered individual screens as well as
                            the overall navigation structure. We reviewed and refined these wireframes weekly with
                            product owners, developers, and expert users. A key focus during this stage was designing
                            content-first, reusable layouts and test responsive behavior to anticipate technical
                            constraints early in the process.

                            Using different base layouts was key to address the diversity of information displayed in

                        <p>
                            Once the structure was validated, I created interactive prototypes in Figma aligned with the
                            SG Markets design system. To ensure continuity and scalability across the platform:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I built reusable design components for shared platform elements.</li>
                            <li>I created templates for recurring information patterns.</li>
                            <li>I established breakpoints and designed key screens across multiple sizes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            We then tested the prototypes with representative users, refining interactions and layouts
                            before handoff. The consistency achieved early through shared components and templates
                            significantly accelerated subsequent delivery cycles.

                        <p>
                            We established shared rituals to integrate UX seamlessly into the product lifecycle. This
                            included presenting our UX methodology and expected deliverables, mapping responsibilities
                            across each phase of the design cycle, and visualizing the UX plan in shared documents
                            aligned with the global roadmap. Over time, we refined this collaboration rhythm, ensuring
                            smooth alignment and efficient decision-making during our weekly working sessions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My priority was to involve developers from the earliest stages of the design process,
                            especially given the migration context and the technical challenges introduced by responsive
                            layouts. By testing solutions both in Figma and in development environments, we were able to
                            refine breakpoints and layout behaviors early, ensuring a seamless experience across
                            devices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Developers’ input helped us identify edge cases sooner and validate user flows with
                            technical
                            feasibility in mind. As a result, we enriched our handoff materials with detailed
                            interaction states, accessibility considerations, and logic specifications to support
                            accurate implementation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout development, we held weekly follow-up sessions to review component and layout
                            progress, and conducted design reviews directly in test environments to ensure the final
                            product remained faithful to the intended design.
