                    <p>
                        Career guidance platforms play a crucial role in helping individuals make informed (and often,
                        life-shaping) decisions about their paths. However, they typically feel like administrative
                        tools, functional but uninspiring. In collaboration with Addeo, of the Orient'Est platform for
                        the Grand Est region in France, and with KTH Royal Institute of Technology, where this work
                        became
                        my thesis, I set out to explore whether playful design could transform this serious context
                        into something more engaging and meaningful. Using the experimental PLEX framework and
                        participatory design workshops, I led the ideation and design of Orient'Est Métiers, a mobile
                        career guidance platform. The challenge was not to "gamify" orientation, but to thoughtfully
                        integrate playfulness that would help users explore careers differently, build authentic goals,
                        and stay engaged with their professional development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The result: an interactive prototype that successfully elicited specific playful experiences,
                        with 9 out of 10 users perceiving the overall experience as playful, proving that play has a
                        place beyond entertainment and that it can be used as a tool to ideate better user experiences.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="h3">Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        I began by analyzing both the existing Orient’Est platform and the broader landscape of career
                        guidance tools. Since the company had already surfaced key needs and pain points for Orient’Est
                        Métiers, I used those insights as well, defining where design could meaningfully shift user
                        behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this foundation in place, I facilitated three PLEX Scenario workshops with diverse
                        participants. These sessions surfaced user stories from randomly drawn playful experiences,
                        that were mapped to concrete interaction flows. This emotional-to-functional mapping ultimately
                        provided the basis for the design of an interactive prototype that captured the specific
                        experiences we set out to evoke.

                        <p>
                            Working with six participants in pairs across three workshop sessions, I used PLEX Cards—a
                            framework of 22 playful experiences—to co-create user stories based on emotional journeys.
                            Each group imagined a career-guidance scenario using three randomly drawn cards, each
                            representing a different playful experience, and then arranged them into a three-step
                            narrative (beginning, continuation, and end) to shape the story.

                        <p>
                            I then analyzed the user stories and participant's reflections over a blank canvas, and
                            started exploring how to better adjust these ideas to the context and expectations.
                            This led to the definition of five key user flows, each designed to evoke specific playful
                            experiences identified in the workshops. These flows represented the core actions within the
                            platform, such as creating an account, exploring careers, and setting goals, and established
                            the structural foundation for the product.

                            <p>
                                Starting with Crazy 8's sketches for each flow, I created digital wireframes to test
                                structure and user actions. From there, I developed a visual identity (colors,
                                typography, and logo) aligned with Orient’Est’s brand but also influenced by the
                                project’s playful character. As the prototype evolved, these elements became reusable
                                components forming a lightweight design system. The final interactive prototype included
                                27 mobile screens with playful elements such as Lottie animations and interactive
                                components, allowing users to be fully immersed during testing sessions on their
                                mobile device.

                        <p>
                            Career guidance platforms typically present careers only as endless scrollable lists or
                            search
                            results, overwhelming and disconnected from the relationships between fields. Users needed a
                            way to understand how domains relate to each other while exploring freely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I designed an interactive visualization where career domains appear as sized bubbles—larger
                            bubbles represent fields with more opportunities in Grand Est. Users can tap domains to
                            reveal related careers, explore parent-child relationships, and understand the career
                            landscape spatially. The interaction feels less like searching a database and more like
                            exploring a landscape, eliciting Discovery and Exploration at every tap.

                        <p>
                            Career goals feel abstract and distant, especially for students. The platform needed to help
                            users commit to a goal and support them along the way, visualizing their progress in a
                            motivating way.

                        <p>
                            I created 'My journey,' a personal space where users collect interesting careers in 'My
                            careers,' then set a goal when ready. The moment of goal-setting triggers a celebratory
                            animation (Thrill), acknowledging the commitment. Then, users are presented with their
