                    Career guidance platforms play a crucial role in helping individuals make life-shaping decisions
                    about their paths. However, they typically feel like uninspiring
                    administrative
                    tools. In collaboration with KTH and Addeo, I set out to explore
                    whether playful design could transform serious contexts
                    into engaging and meaningful experiences. Using the experimental PLEX framework, I led the
                    ideation and design of Orient'Est Métiers, a mobile
                    career guidance platform, with the goal of integrating playfulness in a way that would help
                    users explore careers differently, build authentic goals, and stay engaged with their
                    professional development.

                                I began by analyzing both the existing Orient’Est platform and the broader landscape of
                                career
                                guidance tools. Since the company had already surfaced key needs and pain points for
                                Orient’Est
                                Métiers, I used those insights as well, defining where design could meaningfully shift
                                user
                                behavior.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With this foundation in place, I facilitated three PLEX Scenario workshops with diverse
                                participants. These sessions surfaced user stories from randomly drawn playful
                                experiences,
                                that were mapped to concrete interaction flows. This emotional-to-functional mapping
                                ultimately
                                provided the basis for the design of an interactive prototype that captured the specific
                                experiences we set out to evoke.

                                Working with six participants in pairs across three workshop sessions, I used PLEX
                                Cards—a
                                framework of 22 playful experiences—to co-create user stories based on emotional
                                journeys.
                                Each group imagined a career-guidance scenario using three randomly drawn cards, each
                                representing a different playful experience, and then arranged them into a three-step
                                narrative (beginning, continuation, and end) to shape the story:

                                This led to the definition of five key user flows, each designed to evoke specific
                                playful
                                experiences identified in the workshops. These flows represented the core actions within

                                platform, such as creating an account, exploring careers, and setting goals, and

                                Starting with Crazy 8's sketches for each flow, I created digital wireframes to test
                                structure and user actions. From there, I developed a visual identity (colors,
                                typography, and logo) aligned with Orient’Est’s brand but also influenced by the
                                project’s playful character. As the prototype evolved, these elements became reusable
                                components forming a lightweight design system. The final interactive prototype included
                                27 mobile screens with playful elements such as Lottie animations and interactive
                                components, allowing users to be fully immersed during testing sessions on their
